# First attempt : handwired keyboard

Trying to adapt this design https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3478494 into an OSI layout.
I also modified the logo on the case.
3D printed case and handwired components which is why, with my limited skill in soldering, the design worked for a bit then stopped working and I don't really want to spend more time on this.
